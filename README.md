# Stylelint Disable Snippets

This is a tiny extension includes the disable rules for Stylelint. Created because I kept having to google them.

## How to

* Start typing `stylelint-disable` in a CSS, SCSS or LESS files to trigger the snippet autocomplete.
* Type the rule you want to disable or leave empty to disable all rules.
* Press `tab` to drop your cursor at a helpful position.
* Press `option+â†“` to move the current line down. This is useful if you are wrapping a block of
  code.
